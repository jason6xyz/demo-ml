# Demo ML

## Overview

**Demo ML** is a project designed to illustrate key concepts and algorithms in machine learning. This repository includes practical examples that demonstrate the application of various algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics. The aim is to provide a hands-on understanding of machine learning principles, particularly focusing on regression analysis and the evaluation of model performance.

## Features

- **Well-Known Datasets**: Utilizes publicly available datasets to ensure accessibility and ease of understanding.
- **Comprehensive Explanations**: Each example includes detailed explanations of the underlying concepts, making it suitable for both beginners and those looking to deepen their knowledge.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Demonstrates how to handle categorical variables, missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Showcases various regression algorithms and their evaluation using metrics such as R-squared and Adjusted R-squared.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots to visualize actual vs. predicted values, enhancing the understanding of model performance.
